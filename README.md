# Beacon Launcher - Relay

This app relays beacon-launchers start information. It needs to be set as the app to launch scummvm games. After that, beacon launcher launches this app, but this app immediately opens scummvm with the parsed information.


Current Requirements:

- ScummVM Debug Build
- The Scraped Files need to be in the .dpt file format (Daijishou Player Template)[https://github.com/TapiocaFox/Daijishou/wiki/Players-and-File-Extensions#scummvm]
- or need to contain a line with `[scummvm_id] gameid`

This app is provided as is, and no support will be provided.

You can customize the app to your liking, adapting it to other emulators as needed.
